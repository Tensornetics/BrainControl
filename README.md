# BrainControl
BrainControl is a program that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to allow users to control a robotic assembly using their brain activity. It is powered by the BrainFlow library, which is used to acquire and analyze data from an EEG sensor.

The program applies data filters and averages the data over 1 second windows, and then uses the average activity in different frequency bands (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta, and mu) to control the movement of the assembly. This allows the user to control the assembly in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) using their brain activity, simply by focusing or relaxing their attention in different ways.

BrainControl is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, with a simple interface that allows users to quickly and easily control the robotic assembly. It is also highly flexible and can be customized to meet the specific needs and goals of different projects.

Overall, BrainControl is a powerful and innovative tool for researchers, developers, and other users interested in building brain-machine interfaces and exploring the potential of brain-controlled robotics.
